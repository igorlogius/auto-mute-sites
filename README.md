<b>Usage/Features:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        Click the action button to add a site to the mute list and instantly mute them (the button will display (ON) for those sites.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clicking the action button again will remove the site and unmute all muted tabs
        (individual unmuting is not restircted, when gets overwriten, when sites are added or removed to the mute list)
    </li>
    <li>
        Since the addon was made with Android in mind, the UI is as minimal as possible, and there is no overview of muted sites, 
        The action button is the indication if a site is on the muted list
    </li>
</ul>
